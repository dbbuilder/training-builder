    # Chapter 5 Topics Learned

    **API Architecture with tRPC**

    Quick reference of key concepts covered in this chapter.

    ---

    ## Core Concepts

    - **tRPC**: TypeScript-first RPC framework that provides end-to-end type safety
      between client and server without code generation

    - **Procedures**: Type-safe API functions that can be queries (read data) or
      mutations (write data)

    - **Routers**: Organized collections of related procedures (e.g., `partsRouter`,
      `ordersRouter`)

    - **Context**: Shared state available to all procedures, including Prisma client
      and user session

    ## Technical Skills

    - **Setting up tRPC**: Configure tRPC in Next.js 14 with App Router support

    - **Creating procedures**: Define type-safe API endpoints with input validation
      and TypeScript return types

    - **Input validation**: Use Zod schemas to validate procedure inputs at runtime

    - **Error handling**: Throw typed errors with TRPCError for consistent error
      responses

    ## Tools & Technologies

    - **@trpc/server**: Server-side tRPC library for defining routers and procedures

    - **@trpc/client**: Client-side library for calling procedures with full type
      inference

    - **@trpc/react-query**: React hooks for tRPC procedures built on TanStack Query

    - **Zod**: Schema validation library for runtime type checking

    ## Parts-Co Application Features

    - **Parts API**: tRPC router with procedures to list, search, and filter auto
      parts

    - **Type-safe catalog**: Frontend automatically knows exact structure of parts
      data from API

    - **Input validation**: All API calls validated with Zod schemas before
      processing

    ## Best Practices

    - **Organize by domain**: Group related procedures into domain routers (parts,
      orders, customers)

    - **Validate all inputs**: Always use Zod schemas for procedure inputs to catch
      invalid data

    - **Type return values**: Explicitly type procedure return values for better
      autocomplete

    - **Use context**: Share common resources (Prisma, session) via tRPC context
      instead of globals

    ## Related Topics

    - **Prisma ORM** (Chapter 4) - Used within tRPC procedures for database access
    - **Authentication** (Chapter 7) - Will add protected procedures requiring login
    - **Frontend integration** (Chapter 12) - Will use these procedures in React
      components
