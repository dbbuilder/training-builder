    short_answer: "20% (2-3 questions)"

  multiple_choice:
    options: "4 options (a, b, c, d)"
    correct_answers: "1 correct, 3 plausible distractors"
    explanation: "Always provide explanation for correct answer"
    example: |
      What is tRPC primarily used for?
      a) Database migrations
      b) End-to-end type safety ✓
      c) CSS styling
      d) Image optimization

      **Explanation:** tRPC provides type-safe communication between frontend and backend using TypeScript types without code generation.

  true_false:
    format: "Statement followed by True/False options"
    explanation: "Explain why it's true or false"
    example: |
      True or False: TypeScript eliminates the need for runtime validation.

      **Answer:** False ✓

      **Explanation:** TypeScript validates at compile time, but runtime validation (e.g., with Zod) is still needed to protect against malicious input or external data sources.

  short_answer:
    format: "Open-ended question requiring 2-4 sentence answer"
    rubric: "Provide model answer and key points to include"
    example: |
      Explain the difference between Server Components and Client Components in Next.js 14.

      **Model Answer:**
      Server Components render on the server and send HTML to the client, reducing JavaScript bundle size and improving performance. Client Components run in the browser and can use React hooks, event handlers, and browser APIs. Server Components are the default in the App Router, while Client Components require the 'use client' directive.

qa_faq_standards:
  total_questions: "10-15 questions per chapter"
  categories:
    conceptual: "30% - 'What is...?' 'Why do we use...?'"
    practical: "40% - 'How do I...?' 'What's the best way to...?'"
    troubleshooting: "20% - 'Why isn't my... working?' 'How do I fix...?'"
    best_practices: "10% - 'Should I...?' 'When should I...?'"

  answer_style:
    length: "2-5 sentences (50-150 words)"
    format: "Direct answer first, then explanation"
    tone: "Helpful, not dismissive"
    links: "Include relevant documentation links when applicable"

  example_questions:
    - q: "What's the difference between tRPC and REST APIs?"
      a: "tRPC provides end-to-end type safety using TypeScript, while REST is a more general architectural style without built-in typing. With tRPC, you get autocomplete and type checking from backend to frontend without code generation. REST requires manual type definitions or OpenAPI schemas. For TypeScript full-stack apps, tRPC eliminates the need for separate API contracts."

    - q: "How do I debug tRPC procedure errors?"
      a: "Check the browser console for the full error message and stack trace. tRPC errors include context about which procedure failed. Verify your Zod input validation schema matches what you're sending. Use the Network tab to inspect the actual request payload. On the backend, add console.log statements in your procedure to trace execution. Enable verbose logging in your tRPC configuration for more details."

    - q: "Should I use Server Components or Client Components for data fetching?"
      a: "Prefer Server Components for initial data fetching - they fetch on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance. Use Client Components when you need interactivity (forms, buttons) or browser APIs. You can compose both: fetch data in a Server Component and pass it as props to Client Components for interaction. This pattern is called 'server-first rendering.'"

cross_references:
  format: "Chapter number and section (e.g., 'See Chapter 3, Data Seeding')"
  frequency: "2-3 cross-references per chapter"

  examples:
    - "We set up PostgreSQL in Chapter 2 - if you skipped that section, go back now."
    - "In Chapter 9, we'll use these tRPC fundamentals to build complex order processing."
    - "Remember the normalization principles from the database course? We're applying them here."

    - "Provide text alternatives for visual information"

inclusive_language:
  pronouns: "Use gender-neutral 'they/their' for hypothetical developers"
  examples:
    - preferred: "When a developer encounters this error, they should..."
    - avoid: "When a developer encounters this error, he should..."

  assumptions:
    - "Don't assume prior knowledge beyond stated prerequisites"
    - "Define acronyms on first use in each chapter"

    - "Code examples are complete and runnable"
    - "Cross-references are accurate"
    - "Terminology is consistent with style guide"
    - "Formatting follows standards (headings, code blocks, callouts)"
    - "No typos or grammatical errors"
    - "Appropriate difficulty level for chapter position"
